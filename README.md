## Because of our limited resources, our Amadeus API key has been removed. Flight information will not be displayed.   

# Project-one  
Problem Statement:  
Sometimes when you are taking some time off unexpectedly or just want ideas for a vacation you may want a high-level planning application without the need to dig deep into a website or multiple websites.
Without this app, you can google a destination & then review your search result or other sites for other things like flights and hotels.  This takes time.
This site is intended to give you a snapshot of what this vacation may be like for the given location and dates and gives information of trending searches.

## Value Proposition/ Future Direction:
This gives an initial snapshot of flights, activities, hotels and advisory information.  It is intended to be used at the very start of your vacation planning
Though for initial planning phase of a vacation it will eventually provide them with links so they can drill down and actually book their vacations
Future direction includes integration to booking/ reservations and links to social media
APIs would be moved to production level to enhance application performance
We would also add an offline version for mobile download
