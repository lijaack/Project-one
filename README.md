# Project-one

##Problem Statement:  
Sometimes when you are taking some time off unexpectedly or just want ideas for a vacation you may want a high-level planning application without the need to dig deep into a website or multiple websites.
Without this app, you can google a destination & then review your search result or other sites for other things like flights and hotels.  This takes time.
This site is intended to give you a snapshot of what this vacation may be like for the given location and dates and gives information of trending searches.

##Value Proposition/ Future Direction:
This gives an initial snapshot of flights, activities, hotels and advisory information.  It is intended to be used at the very start of your vacation planning
Though for initial planning phase of a vacation it will eventually provide them with links so they can drill down and actually book their vacations
Future direction includes integration to booking/ reservations and links to social media
APIs would be moved to production level to enhance application performance
We would also add an offline version for mobile download

##Tech used

##APIs
Amadeus (flight info)
Yelp (activities)
Google (city images & maps)
Tugo (travel info/ advisories)

##Languages
jQuery
HTML
JavaScript

##Libraries

Font Awesome (icons) in each section

##Key Features

Modal html functionality via Bootstrap
Call to Amadeus to get flight info then loops through in app to get the cheapest 10 flights in modal.  Search either via name or IATA code

Firebase issues 
 - Storing trendig difficult to solution
 - Difficult to find Firebase documentation
 - No deep knowledge on team 
 
Other issues:

No consistency in apis/ each requires independent research
Github branching and use cumbersome.
Media queries - had to be done via JS not in CSS
